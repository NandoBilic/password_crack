The number of variations hashes are changing each letter to a capital 6 variations + trying 0-9 (10 numbers) 3 times so + 30 variations + checking once if password is direct match. For a total of 37 variations * 2 password guesses (74). The two password guesses are all duplicate checks where all the same letters in the same order are checked and then the last digit runs through all number variations. Since a majority of the checking variations come from digits it would save us redundant work if we seperated a passwords words and numbers. We could store the charachters in a table and before checking a password see if the guess matches a word that has already been guessed. If so there is no point in running it even if the numbers are different since our program will check for that already.
